# GitKarma: Make Code Reviews Earn Their Keep

_A playful rebellion against slow PRs — and a promise to fix them._

**TL;DR:** Code reviews are the lifeblood of healthy engineering teams. But they’re slow, inconsistent, and often feel like unpaid emotional labor. GitKarma turns reviewing into a measurable, enforceable system: reviewers earn karma for quality reviews; authors spend small amounts to prioritize merges; and teams regain fast, reliable feedback loops. Visit [**gitkarma.dev**](https://gitkarma.dev) to try it.

## The problem — unglamorous, universal, and ridiculously costly

Every engineering team knows this scene: a developer opens a PR at 9:03am, goes for coffee, and returns at 11:18am to find the PR still waiting. Days pass. Context is lost. Rollbacks happen. Momentum dies.

We treat code review like honorary volunteer work. It’s something good teammates _should_ do, but it’s also the first thing to slip when calendars get tight or managers move on. That cost is subtle — missed deadlines, overloaded engineers, and increased risk — but it compounds faster than you think.

Slow reviews are a productivity tax. We pay it with wasted cycles, frustrated developers, and shipped bugs.

## Meet GitKarma — make reviews fair, fast, and final

GitKarma flips the script. Instead of relying on goodwill and sticky notes, it creates a transparent system for review labor inside your team. The rules are simple and human-friendly:

- **Earn for quality:** Reviewers earn points (karma) when they write helpful, actionable reviews. Quality, not speed, drives rewards.
- **Pay to prioritize:** Authors can spend a little karma to nudge a PR up the queue when it’s critical. This is intentionally small — it’s about prioritization, not paying to bypass safety.
- **Scoreboard > politics:** Karma is visible. Who consistently reviews thoroughly? Who hoards approvals? The data is there.
- **Admin guardrails:** Team leads can set caps, emergency bypasses, and reward multipliers so GitKarma supports your workflow rather than dictating it.

This isn’t bribery. It’s accountability.

## This is not a game. It’s a gate.

This isn’t play. It’s policy.

When a PR stalls, it isn’t an opportunity for a badge — it’s a risk: lost context, delayed releases, and a higher likelihood of bugs in production. GitKarma is a gatekeeper: a procedural control that enforces who reviews what, when, and how well. It turns invisible labor into auditable responsibility.

GitKarma doesn’t entertain; it enforces. It makes review duties explicit, makes prioritization enforceable, and gives teams the tools to prevent critical work from getting stuck behind polite postponements. It doesn’t replace human judgment — it ensures human judgment actually happens.

Use it to make review labor visible. Use it to protect the codebase. Use it to stop treating reviews as optional goodwill and start treating them as the essential process they are.

## Honest use-cases (real teams, real wins)

- **Startup sprint:** A small team needs one critical feature shipped by the end of the week. Authors spend earned karma to prioritize those PRs; the team clears the path without sidelining quality.
- **Distributed org:** With multiple timezones, reviews get staggered. GitKarma surfaces reliable reviewers and helps balance the load so no one gets buried.
- **Platform teams:** Internal platform PRs are notorious for low visibility. Karma makes platform work respected and prioritized proportionally.

## Rules, not chaos

We hear the concerns: “Won’t people game it?” “Will this hurt collaboration?” These are real questions — and preventable when the system is designed right. GitKarma is built with guardrails:

- Review **quality checks** (actionable comments, suggested tests, meaningful diffs reviewed) feed scoring — not arbitrary popularity.
- Admins set **daily caps** on spend and earn to prevent wild swings.
- Emergency bypass exists for on-call and production hotfixes.
- Karma is a signal for decisions, not an absolute decree — team leads still exercise judgment.

The objective is to nudge behavior toward responsibility, not to replace judgment or punish people.

## How to get started (practical, not theoretical)

1. Go to [**gitkarma.dev**](https://github.com/apps/gitkarma-dev).
2. Click on install
3. You're set!

GitKarma comes with **sane defaults** out of the box — you don't need to configure anything to start earning and spending karma. The system works immediately with balanced earning rates, reasonable spend costs, and sensible caps.

**Optional next steps:**

- Fine-tune karma points awarded or charged in the admin page at [**gitkarma.dev**](https://gitkarma.dev)
- Run a pilot with one team for 2–4 sprints and watch the feedback loop
- Adjust rules based on real usage and share results with the broader org

Start small. Measure. Iterate. Let outcomes prove the model.

## Mission

We want fewer stalled PRs, fewer burnouts, and fewer cliff-hanger mornings waiting for feedback. That’s not marketing fluff — that’s the product. GitKarma’s mission is simple:

**Make review labor visible. Reward the people who do it well. Restore velocity without sacrificing quality.**

No drama. No moralizing. Just a system that respects time and improves outcomes.

## One last thing (because culture matters)

Tools don’t fix culture — people do. GitKarma is most effective in teams that already value feedback and empathy. If you’re using it to punish, micromanage, or replace human judgment, stop. Use it to amplify the good: clearer feedback, faster merges, and a fairer distribution of effort.
