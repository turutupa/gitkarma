/**
 * handlePullRequestSynchronize:
 *
 * This handler is invoked when a pull request creator pushes a new commit (i.e. a "synchronize" event).
 *
 * - Checks existing status: If the PR is already marked as having passed the GitKarma check, it immediately marks the new commit as successful and exits.
 * - If sufficient tokens are available:
 *   - Charges the user's account by transferring the necessary tokens.
 *   - Posts a comment to the PR with the updated balance.
 *   - Marks the GitKarma check as "completed" with a "success" conclusion.
 * - If tokens are insufficient:
 *   - Posts an error comment indicating the shortfall.
 *   - Marks the GitKarma check as "completed" with a "failure" conclusion.
 *
 * @param {Object} params - An object containing the handler parameters.
 * @param {Octokit} params.octokit - An authenticated Octokit instance for GitHub API interactions.
 * @param {PullRequestSynchronizeEvent} params.payload - The webhook payload for the pull request synchronize event.
 *
 * @returns {Promise<void>} A promise that resolves when the event processing is complete.
